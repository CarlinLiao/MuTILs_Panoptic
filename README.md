## Abstract
Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) have strong prognostic and predictive value in breast cancer, but their visual assessment is subjective. We present MuTILs, a convolutional neural network architecture for the panoptic segmentation of tissue regions and cell nuclei in whole-slide images of breast cancer, specifically optimized for assessing TILs in accordance with clinical scoring recommendations. MuTILs is a concept bottleneck model designed to be interpretable and to encourage sensible predictions at multiple resolutions. Our computational scores match visual scores and have independent prognostic value in invasive breast cancers from the TCGA dataset.
